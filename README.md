<h1>CREDSCORE</h1>

CredScore is a decentralized credit scoring solution designed to provide fair, transparent, and privacy-preserving credit evaluations. Built on blockchain technology, CredScore ensures that users' credit scores are calculated in a decentralized, immutable, and privacy-respecting manner. This app allows users to track and manage their credit scores with confidence, as all transactions and data updates are securely handled using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).

<h2>Features</h2>

**Decentralized Governance:**

Credit score weights can be updated through community-driven proposals, ensuring a fair and transparent process.

**Blockchain Technology:**

Ensures the immutability and transparency of all credit score-related data.

**Privacy Preservation:**

Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to secure sensitive user data while maintaining transparency and trust.

**Customizable Credit Scoring:**

Stakeholders can vote to adjust the credit score metrics and their corresponding weights.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>


**Prerequisites**

To run CredScore locally, you'll need:

1. Node.js and npm

2. Git

3. A modern browser for accessing the front-end

   

<h2>Installation</h2>



**1. Clone the repository:**

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/credscore.git`

`cd credscore`


**2. Install dependencies:**

For the front-end:

`cd frontend`

`npm install`

**3. Run the application:**

`npm run dev`




**Usage**

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or another port based on your configuration) to interact with the CredScore application.

Users can view their credit scores, propose changes to the credit scoring weights, and participate in the governance process.


<h2>How It Works</h2>


**Credit Score Calculation:** 

The app calculates the credit score based on various factors like payment history, credit utilization, and more. The weight assigned to each factor is periodically updated through governance proposals.


**Decentralized Governance:**

Community members (stakeholders) vote on proposed changes to credit score weights, ensuring fairness and transparency.


**Privacy:** 

Zero-knowledge proofs are used to ensure that users' financial data is never exposed while still verifying score updates.
